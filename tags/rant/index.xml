used by mathematicias&lt;/strong>. If you&amp;rsquo;re not in the area of mathematical programming,
you probably find it strange for me to be talking about Fortran, so I explain.
Fortran is considered the fastest programming language in mathematics, and most
things made are in this language. Other often used languages such as
MatLab/Octave and Mathematica are high-level, which means they are slower and
are not considered for serious applications.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
