If you&amp;rsquo;re not in the area of mathematical programming, you probably find it strange for me to be talking about Fortran, so I explain. Fortran is considered the fastest programming language in mathematics, and most things made are in this language. Other often used languages such as MatLab/Octave and Mathematica are high-level, which means they are slower and are not considered for serious applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
