Unfortunately, the classification on the site is not updated, and may contain errors, so I decided to create something, with low requirements and high reliability, to select problems according to a criteria.
This work was created before, but used the site&amp;rsquo;s classification as one of the sources of information for the selection.</description></item></channel></rss>
