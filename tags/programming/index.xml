My father had a book on puzzles, and
there were also puzzle magazines. I liked it much
I also liked gaming very much. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember where it started, but I played
a lot.
Well, today I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about games that have programming involved, albeit
indirectly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a very simple game at first. It scales after some levels, but a
programmer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much trouble completing it.
For a non-programmer, it is a great starting point. It really is made for
beginners.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The End of Fortran</title><link>/blog/2014-11-22-the-end-of-fortran/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2014-11-22-the-end-of-fortran/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my main interest is the end of Fortran &lt;strong>as the only programming language
used by mathematicias&lt;/strong>. If you&amp;rsquo;re not in the area of mathematical programming,
you probably find it strange for me to be talking about Fortran, so I explain.
Fortran is considered the fastest programming language in mathematics, and most
things made are in this language. Other often used languages such as
MatLab/Octave and Mathematica are high-level, which means they are slower and
are not considered for serious applications.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
