My father had a book on puzzles, and there were also puzzle magazines. I liked it much I also liked gaming very much. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember where it started, but I played a lot. Well, today I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about games that have programming involved, albeit indirectly.
Light-Bot This is a very simple game at first. It scales after some levels, but a programmer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much trouble completing it.</description></item><item><title>The End of Fortran</title><link>https://abelsiqueira.github.io/blog/2014-11-22-the-end-of-fortran/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abelsiqueira.github.io/blog/2014-11-22-the-end-of-fortran/</guid><description>One of my main interest is the end of Fortran as the only programming language used by mathematicias. If you&amp;rsquo;re not in the area of mathematical programming, you probably find it strange for me to be talking about Fortran, so I explain. Fortran is considered the fastest programming language in mathematics, and most things made are in this language. Other often used languages such as MatLab/Octave and Mathematica are high-level, which means they are slower and are not considered for serious applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
