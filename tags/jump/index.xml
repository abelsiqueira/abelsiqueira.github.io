Numberphile&lt;/a>, in which a game involving graphs is presented.
I recommend you watch the video for complete information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The game involves a graph with integer values on its nodes, positive and
negative. For instance, the following graph:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/blog/2018-09-04/example.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each &lt;strong>node&lt;/strong> corresponds to a person, the &lt;strong>node value&lt;/strong> is the amount of
money that person has, the &lt;strong>edges&lt;/strong> are the people that person can give or
take money from.
The objective of the game is to have everyone have a non-negative amount of money.
In each &lt;strong>move&lt;/strong> of the game, one person decides to give or take money,
&lt;strong>however&lt;/strong>, that person either takes 1 dollar from each of their connections,
or gives 1 dollar to each one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My experience in the JuMP-dev annual workshop</title><link>/blog/2018-07-04-my-experience-in-the-jump-dev-annual-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2018-07-04-my-experience-in-the-jump-dev-annual-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I had the pleasure of being invited to the &lt;a href="http://www.juliaopt.org/meetings/bordeaux2018/">Second annual JuMP-dev
workshop&lt;/a>, which happened in June 27-29,
2018 at Bordeaux, France.
I&amp;rsquo;ve presented the packages from the &lt;a href="https://JuliaSmoothOptimizers.github.io">Julia Smooth
Optimizers&lt;/a> organization, and had a very good
time meeting with the JuMP developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those still unaware, &lt;a href="https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl">JuMP&lt;/a> is a modelling
language for Mathematical Programming written in Julia. It provides access to a few
different solvers for many kinds of problems, and it works inside of Julia, so one can
enjoy the advantages of having a robust language if there is a need for advanced usage.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
