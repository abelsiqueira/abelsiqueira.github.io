During my undergraduate courses, I learned to manage the tasks I had because
they were few and regular.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to remember you have class at 7h30 if every weekday you have class at
7h30. Also, you normally have a group of people around you doing the same
things, so someone usually remembers when something is due.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As years advanced, I started using what I could to remeber tasks. Mostly sending
e-mails to myself, setting alarms on my phone and using Google Agenda.
Well, I still send e-mails to myself, or mark e-mails as unread because it
annoys me to have unread messages, but I mostly use that for &lt;em>read you later&lt;/em>
things, or things without time limit.
Also, I still use the phone alarm to remind myself that a class will start soon.
However, some things have a time frame, so using a calendar-type tool is
necessary, and I also needed a way to move things around.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
