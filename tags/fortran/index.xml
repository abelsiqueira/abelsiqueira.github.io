This fantastic tool has syntax similar to that of Octave/Matlab, but is much faster. Furthermore, the interface with functions made in C and Fortran is much easier to accomplish, and since most things in computational mathematics are on these languages, this feature is wonderful.
My intented work is
make a simple julia and C interface, with auto-compiling and test on GitHub and Travis CI; develop a nonlinear optimization tool completely in Julia, then improve the slow bits by using C and/or Fortran; implement/improve the CUTEst interface [1], [2], possibly creating a SIF converter.</description></item><item><title>The End of Fortran</title><link>https://abelsiqueira.com/blog/2014-11-22-the-end-of-fortran/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abelsiqueira.com/blog/2014-11-22-the-end-of-fortran/</guid><description>One of my main interest is the end of Fortran as the only programming language used by mathematicias. If you&amp;rsquo;re not in the area of mathematical programming, you probably find it strange for me to be talking about Fortran, so I explain. Fortran is considered the fastest programming language in mathematics, and most things made are in this language. Other often used languages such as MatLab/Octave and Mathematica are high-level, which means they are slower and are not considered for serious applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
