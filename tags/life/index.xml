happened since.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had difficulty finding time to write a good post, or even a bad
post, sometimes, but now I return with a brief explaining, and some
possible continuation posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, during the classes period, I have a lot of obligations that use
a lot of time: Preparing classes, tests, projects, grading, etc.
This was most of my time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
