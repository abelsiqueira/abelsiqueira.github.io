See my projects page if you have interest on working with something like that.
In the past, what we had was simply writing all your bibliographies directly on a .tex file. Then, if you needed to write again, you would copy-paste it somewhere. If you made a mistake, you would have to fix it by hand. If the journal changed styles, you would have to change everything by hand.</description></item><item><title>BibCLI - Command Line Interface to Manage Bibliography</title><link>https://abelsiqueira.com/blog/2014-06-04-bibcli/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abelsiqueira.com/blog/2014-06-04-bibcli/</guid><description>After working with references and citations in latex for a while, with multiple files, I noticed that some things need improvement. First of all, you need to use some way to store your bibliography outside of the tex file. For instance, using bibtex. Second, you probably want some bibliography package, such as biblatex or natbib. Third, you need some way to manage your bibliography entries and verify if they are correct.</description></item></channel></rss>
