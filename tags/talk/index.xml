Here are the three main reasons why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>First, I gave no less than 4 talks (not counting anything in-company).&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On 19/January at the &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/julialang-eindhoven/">&lt;strong>JuliaLang Eindhoven Meetup&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.
I talked about the difficulties of maintaining a large ecosystems of packages.
It was the first time I went to Eindhoven, and I met some great people there.
These meetups are still happening around every 2 months.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
