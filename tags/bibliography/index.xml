See my &lt;a href="http://abelsiqueira.github.io/en/projects/">projects page&lt;/a> if you have
interest on working with something like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past, what we had was simply writing all your bibliographies directly on
a .tex file. Then, if you needed to write again, you would copy-paste it
somewhere. If you made a mistake, you would have to fix it by hand. If the
journal changed styles, you would have to change everything by hand.
&lt;strong>If you&amp;rsquo;re still doing this. STOP.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BibCLI - Command Line Interface to Manage Bibliography</title><link>/blog/2014-06-04-bibcli/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2014-06-04-bibcli/</guid><description>&lt;p>After working with references and citations in latex for a while, with
multiple files, I noticed that some things need improvement. First of all, you
need to use some way to store your bibliography &lt;strong>outside&lt;/strong> of the
tex file. For instance, using bibtex. Second, you probably want some
bibliography package, such as biblatex or natbib. Third, you need some way to
manage your bibliography entries and verify if they are correct.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
